This module analyzes Allsky images for cloud cover and writes the (zenith) cloud fraction and cloud change into an Influx DB.
It also includes a web service to query celestial positions for the limiting magnitude, which is calculated in an intermediate step.

Best paired with: [pyobs-allsky](https://gitlab.gwdg.de/iag/k.schimpf/pyobs-allsky)
## How does it work?
The module listens for a new image from the configured camera. If a new image has been captured, an image analysis pipeline is run on the image, depending on the solar altitude when the image was captured. Currently there is only a "night" pipeline, which works best after astronomical twilight (solar altitude below -18Â°).
This pipeline estimates the limiting magnitude of each pixel based on the visibility of the stars. Pixels are considered cloudy if their limiting magnitude falls below a defined threshold.

## Web Service

### Point Query
Returns the cloudiness value of the analyzed sky position closest to the requested position. <br>
**Routes**: <br>
`/query/point?ra={Right ascension in degree}&dec={Declination in degree}` or <br>
`/query/point?alt={Altitude in degree}&az={Azimuth in degree}`

**Example:** <br>
`/query/point?alt=90.0&az=0.0`


**Result:**

| Field    | Type  | Description                                      |
|----------|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| obs_time | float | Observation Unix time of the last analyzed image |
| value    | bool  | If it is cloudy at the requested point           |

### Area Query
Returns the cloud fraction within the requested great circle. 

**Routes**: <br>
`/query/area?ra={Right ascension in degree}&dec={Declination in degree}&radius={Radius in degree}` or <br>
`/query/area?alt={Altitude in degree}&az={Azimuth in degree}&radius={Radius in degree}`

**Example:** <br>
`/query/area?alt=90.0&az=0.0&radius=10.0`

**Result:**

| Field    | Type  | Description                                      |
|----------|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| obs_time | float | Observation Unix time of the last analyzed image |
| value    | float | Cloud fraction in the requested area in percent  |
